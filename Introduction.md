 # Introduction to C++

C++ is a widely-used programming language known for its high performance. It's often used for system software, game development, and embedded systems.

For example, here's a basic C++ "Hello, World!" program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
